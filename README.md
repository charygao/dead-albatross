Tenable.IO Nessus API example works to help other people who are learning.

The intention is to place guided information and examples here.

I've chosen to use BASH and CURL as the most basic and common tools in light of making this easy for network and system administrators.

Requirements:
* Your favourite shell with curl installed
* A Nessus account with Tenable.IO
* API Access Key and Secret Key

I use either 'jq' (https://brew.sh) on MacOS or 'jparse' on linux for parsing JSON.
